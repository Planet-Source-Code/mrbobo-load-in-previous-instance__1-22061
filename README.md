## Load in Previous Instance

### Description

Another example for Beginners from MrBobo.

This example program shows how to communicate between instances of your application. Lets say your application is assosiated to a filetype. The user clicks on such a file and an instance of your application is launched. But what if you want to load the file in the existing instance - not the new one ? There are many examples of how to achieve similar results on PSC. This method is designed for reliability and ease of use with a minimum of code to implement.
